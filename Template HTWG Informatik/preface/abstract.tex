This is the abstract.
\todogen{Write abstract, may consider guidelines}
Writing an abstract and conclusion is what you do at the very end of your thesis. 
Questions that might help to write a good abstract are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Motivation: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
		\item Problem statement: What problem are you trying to solve?
		\item Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?
		\item Results: What's the answer?
		\item Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all of the previous results are useful)? 		
	\end{itemize}

Do not itemize in final version.
